# Code Challenge 

## Technology used
* R/R Studio
* mySQL

## Assumptions
* new files will be of the same format and layout
* No duplicates within the file provided
* Using local MySQL DB
* [SQL side] no duplicated between different files supplied
* [SQL side] rainfall table has already been set up


## Improvements
* The for loop is extremely slow and I don't like the idea of looping for a fixed number of years. Would be better to loop until the next 'Grid-ref'
* DB password is in the script - not good!
